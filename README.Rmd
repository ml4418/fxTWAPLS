## Overview

The goal of `fxTWAPLS` is ...

## Installation

### Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) for Github
This is needed to install packages from private repositories. Once configured,
there is no need to configure it again.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("usethis")
usethis::browse_github_pat(scopes = "repo", 
                           description = "R:GITHUB_PAT", 
                           host = "https://github.com/special-uor")
```
Copy the generated token. Then, run the following command:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Add a new line to the `.Renviron` file:
```bash
GITHUB_PAT=xxxyyyzzz
```

Make sure to leave a new empty line after `GITHUB_PAT`. Restart R (Session > 
Restart R in the RStudio menu bar), as environment variables are loaded from 
`.Renviron` only at the start of an R session. 
Check that the PAT is now available like so:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

<!-- You can install the released version of fxTWAPLS from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("fxTWAPLS") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->
You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
``` r
# install.packages(c("hexSticker", "remotes", "usethis"))
remotes::install_github("special-uor/fxTWAPLS")
```
