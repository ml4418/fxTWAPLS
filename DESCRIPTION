Description: The goal of fxTWAPLS is to provide an improvement of WAPLS by 
    including the tolerances of taxa and the frequency of the sampled climate 
    variable. This package also provides a way of leave-out cross-validation 
    that removes both the test site and sites that are both geographically 
    close and climatically close for each cycle, to avoid the risk of 
    pseudo-replication.
